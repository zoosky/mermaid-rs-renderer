## Improvement Prioritization Benchmark

Use `scripts/priority_bench.py` to rank where layout work should focus next by combining
quality pain (crossings, node-edge intersections, bends, port congestion, overlaps,
edge detour, and whitespace efficiency) with layout time.
Priority weights are derived automatically from the fixture corpus by default
(`--weight-mode auto`) to reduce hand-tuned bias.

```bash
# Full suite (tests + benches)
python3 scripts/priority_bench.py --runs 3 --warmup 1

# Focus flowchart family first
python3 scripts/priority_bench.py --pattern flowchart --top 15

# Use fixed fallback weights only if needed
python3 scripts/priority_bench.py --pattern flowchart --weight-mode manual
```

The script writes a machine-readable report to `target/priority-bench.json` and prints:
- top fixtures by quality pain
- top quick wins by pain-per-layout-millisecond
- top fixtures by space inefficiency (large-diagram-weighted wasted space, component gap, center offset)
- per-fixture crossing density (`cross/edge`) to normalize readability hotspots across diagram sizes

Recent stress fixtures for visual quality include:
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_ports_heavy.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_weave.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_backedges_subgraphs.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_sparse_components.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_lanes_crossfeed.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_grid_feedback.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_fanout_returns.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_label_collision.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_nested_clusters.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_asymmetric_components.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_parallel_merges.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_long_edge_labels.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_selfloop_bidi.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_component_packing.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_direction_conflict.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_parallel_label_stack.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_port_alignment_matrix.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_path_occlusion_maze.mmd`
- `benches/fixtures/flowchart_subgraph_boundary_intrusion.mmd`

Latest flowchart quality compare (`scripts/quality_bench.py --engine both --pattern flowchart`, February 6, 2026):
- `mmdr`: 30 fixtures, average weighted score `435.06`
- `mermaid-cli`: 30 fixtures, average weighted score `1140.45`
- `mmdr avg wasted space ratio`: `0.177`
- `mmdr avg edge detour ratio`: `1.253`
- `mmdr avg component gap ratio`: `0.086`
- `mmdr avg label out-of-bounds count`: `0.000`

Recent layout/readability fixes validated by these runs:
- Fixed flowchart parsing of hyphenated pipe labels (no phantom nodes from labels like `|high-risk order|`).
- Edge-label placement now clamps to canvas bounds and optimizes overlap first, removing suite-level label clipping.
- Added multi-anchor edge-label search (longest-segment + path-fraction anchors) and priority-aware edge routing order on larger graphs, reducing crossings on heavy backedge fixtures.
- Added an objective stage between placement and routing:
  - class multiplicity edge-span relaxation (removed multiplicity label-label overlap in `tests/fixtures/class/multiplicity.mmd`)
  - tiny-cycle overlap resolution (removed node overlap and label overlap in `tests/fixtures/flowchart/cycles.mmd`)
  - chain-aware top-level subgraph wrapping for very large flowcharts (`benches/fixtures/flowchart_large.mmd` aspect elongation `153.63 -> 1.71`, wasted space `0.286 -> 0.071`).
- `label_overlap_count` now ignores tiny text-box slivers (`<= 10px²`) to
  reduce host/font jitter noise in cross-machine comparisons.

## Benchmark History Logging

`scripts/quality_bench.py` now appends a JSONL run history record by default:
- file: `tmp/benchmark-history/quality-runs.jsonl`
- metadata: timestamp, CLI args, fixture/pattern selection, host info, git commit SHA, branch, dirty state
- summaries: average scores and comparison/dominance stats (for `--engine both`)

Disable per run if needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/quality_bench.py --engine both --no-history-log
```

Mermaid-cli caching is enabled by default for `quality_bench.py` and
`label_bench.py`:
- cache dir: `tmp/benchmark-cache/mmdc`
- cache key inputs: fixture contents, config contents, mermaid-cli command,
  mermaid-cli version, and benchmark script revision

Useful flags:

```bash
python3 scripts/quality_bench.py --engine both --mmdc-cache-dir tmp/benchmark-cache/mmdc
python3 scripts/quality_bench.py --engine both --no-mmdc-cache
python3 scripts/label_bench.py --engine both --no-mmdc-cache
```

## Label Path-Gap Benchmark

To benchmark edge-label placement directly, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/label_bench.py --engine both --pattern flowchart
```

This benchmark reports `edge_label_path_gap_*` metrics where:
- `edge_label_path_gap_mean`: average label-box to nearest edge-path gap
- `edge_label_path_gap_p95`: 95th percentile gap
- `edge_label_path_touch_ratio`: fraction of labels touching their nearest edge path (`0` gap)
- `edge_label_path_non_touch_ratio`: fraction of labels not touching their nearest edge path (`1 - touch_ratio`)
- `edge_label_path_optimal_gap_score_mean`: average optimal-gap quality score in `[0,1]`
  where `1` means diagram-specific ideal clearance from the edge path
- `edge_label_path_too_close_ratio`: fraction of labels that are too close to the path
  (for sequence diagrams, this captures line-through-label cases)
- `edge_label_path_in_band_ratio`: fraction of labels in the diagram-specific target clearance band
- `edge_label_path_gap_bad_ratio`: fraction of labels beyond diagram-specific gap thresholds

Scoring model notes:
- Sequence diagrams use label-kind-aware clearance targets:
  center message labels prefer a stable positive offset above the path, while
  start/end endpoint labels use a smaller near-path target.
- Flowchart/class/state/ER keep a near-path target band by default.
- Sequence benchmark summaries and threshold checks prefer owned edge-label
  metrics when mapping coverage is high, reducing false positives from
  unrelated nearby message lines.

## Large-Diagram Space Benchmark

To prioritize whitespace waste only when diagrams are large, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/priority_bench.py --pattern flowchart --top 10
```

Key large-space metrics:
- `large_diagram_space_weight`: `0..1` scale factor (near `0` for small diagrams)
- `wasted_space_large_ratio`: `wasted_space_ratio * large_diagram_space_weight`
- `space_efficiency_large_penalty`: `space_efficiency_penalty * large_diagram_space_weight`
- `component_gap_large_ratio`: `component_gap_ratio * large_diagram_space_weight`

`priority_bench` now ranks “space inefficiency” using these large-diagram-weighted
terms first, so small fixtures do not dominate whitespace regressions.
It also prints a dedicated section: `Top by large-diagram unused space`.

Optional quality gates in `quality_bench.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/quality_bench.py \
  --engine mmdr \
  --max-sequence-too-close 0.05 \
  --max-large-space-ratio 0.20 \
  --max-flowchart-crossings-per-edge 1.50 \
  --min-large-space-weight 0.25
```

- `--max-sequence-too-close`: fails if any sequence fixture exceeds the ratio,
  preferring explicitly owned edge-label mapping metrics when available.
- `--max-large-space-ratio`: fails if any sufficiently large fixture exceeds weighted waste.
- `--max-flowchart-crossings-per-edge`: fails if large flowcharts exceed crossing density.
- `--min-large-space-weight`: excludes small diagrams from the large-space gate.

Candidate selection details:
- If explicit edge-label boxes are present in SVG, only those boxes are scored.
- Sequence rendering now emits explicit `.edgeLabel` rectangles for message labels
  (in addition to text) so sequence path-gap metrics are measured against the
  rendered label box geometry instead of inferred text-only bounds.
- Fallback text-label scoring is enabled only for fixtures that appear to contain
  explicit edge labels in source syntax.
- Sequence fallback candidates are capped to the expected message-label count and
  ranked by nearest-path gap to avoid actor/footbox text polluting label metrics.

Run history for this benchmark is also logged by default to:
- `tmp/benchmark-history/label-runs.jsonl`

`scripts/priority_bench.py` now appends run history by default to:
- `tmp/benchmark-history/priority-runs.jsonl`

`scripts/bench_compare.py` now appends run history by default to:
- `tmp/benchmark-history/bench-compare-runs.jsonl`

`scripts/bench_compare.py` also supports mermaid-cli result caching by default
to avoid rerunning slow CLI loops on unchanged inputs:
- cache dir default: `tmp/benchmark-cache/bench-compare/mmdc`
- cache key inputs: fixture contents, mermaid-cli command + version, bench
  sampling settings (`MMD_CLI_RUNS`, `MMD_CLI_WARMUP`), and optional
  `MMDC_CONFIG`
- default mermaid-cli sampling is lightweight for speed:
  `MMD_CLI_RUNS=1`, `MMD_CLI_WARMUP=0` (override as needed)
- mermaid-cli execution is parallelized by default with
  `MMD_CLI_JOBS=min(4, cpu_count)`; set `MMD_CLI_JOBS=1` for serial runs
- when `MMD_CLI_WARMUP=0`, bench runs do not perform an extra preflight CLI
  invocation, so cold runtime scales with measured run count only
- mermaid-cli memory probing is opt-in (`MMD_CLI_MEASURE_MEMORY=1`) because it
  adds an extra CLI execution per case
- mmdr memory probing is also opt-in (`MMDR_MEASURE_MEMORY=1`) because it adds
  one extra mmdr execution per case
- each run prints a runtime breakdown (`mmdr`, `mermaid-cli`, charts, history,
  total) and writes runtime fields into bench history records

Useful environment knobs:

```bash
MMDC_CACHE_DIR=tmp/benchmark-cache/bench-compare/mmdc python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
NO_MMDC_CACHE=1 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMDC_CONFIG=tests/fixtures/modern-config.json python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMD_CLI_RUNS=5 MMD_CLI_WARMUP=1 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMD_CLI_JOBS=1 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMD_CLI_JOBS=4 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMD_CLI_MEASURE_MEMORY=1 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
MMDR_MEASURE_MEMORY=1 python3 scripts/bench_compare.py
```

Each history record includes timestamp, git commit/branch/dirty state, host metadata, run settings, and summary metrics.
