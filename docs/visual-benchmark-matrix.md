## Recent Engine Fixes Verified By Benchmarks

- Flowchart parser no longer splits pipe labels containing hyphens into phantom nodes
  (e.g. `|high-risk order|`).
- Edge-label placement now clamps to canvas bounds and uses overlap-first candidate
  selection, eliminating label clipping on the flowchart suite (`avg label out-of-bounds count: 0.000` in latest run).
- Edge routing now uses priority-aware ordering on larger flowcharts to reduce dense
  backedge crossings while preserving small-graph behavior.
- Edge labels now evaluate multiple anchor candidates along each path, improving
  readability on long-label and dense parallel-edge fixtures.
- A visual objective stage now runs after node placement:
  - class multiplicity edge-span relaxation to avoid endpoint/center label pileups
  - tiny cyclic-flow overlap resolution to remove node-label overlap in `tests/fixtures/flowchart/cycles.mmd`
  - chain-aware wrapping for large top-level subgraph chains (`flowchart_large.mmd`) to prevent unusable ultra-wide canvases.

## Weighting

Priority scoring uses `scripts/priority_bench.py --weight-mode auto` by default.
Weights are derived programmatically from fixture metrics (variance + inter-metric correlation),
so tuning does not depend on manually picked constants.
